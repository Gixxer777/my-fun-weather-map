# My Fun Weather Map

## Description

This website was built to be able to see the forecast of the weather for 5 days so a person can schedule a trip. I learned about using the OpenWeatherMap API as well as their Geocoding API. This is a work in progress and will need alot more work. It was built using version 3.0 as I was trying to do everything myself until I couldn't anymore and was being different.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Upon loading, you will see a weather search bar for a city of your choice. You can search a city and it will be loaded into the console with information about the weather for the city. In the future, it will have all of the information appended to the proper sections, if I can figure this stuff out.
